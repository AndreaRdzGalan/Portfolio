<h1>About me</h1>

<div class="Me"> 
<img src="./Photos/Yo.png"> 
<p>Since I was little I love the cartoons, and drawing it and color them.
    I also love taking photos of animals, plants or products. 
    And the idea of merging the photo with illustration arose thanks to a school project where we had to create a story but incorporate textures of real objects through photographs.
    In the same class we made a comic using only photographs, so I made mine with Harry Potter stickers. And I enojoyed thhose projects so much that I wanted to continue expanding that technique into my illustration, as it combines my two favourite hobbies unto one.</p>
